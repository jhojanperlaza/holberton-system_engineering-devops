# 0x15. API

## API
An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

## REST API?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) help this type of communication between systems by providing an interface for them to talk to each other. REST is simply a widely adopted style of API that we use to communicate with internal and external parties in a consistent and predictable way. It can be compared with how we used to send a letter with a postage stamp, address, and envelope in a certain way to ensure it gets delivered and read.

REST is commonly used by people on the web systems to interact with each other. For example, retrieving and updating account information in a social media application.
